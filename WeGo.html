						<p>We Go is a multi-cloud project designed as a Transportation as a Service (TaaS) Platform, focusing on autonomous vehicle delivery of medical supplies, particularly vaccines. The project strategically aims to capitalize on high-performance teamwork, Software Engineering (SWE) Best Practices, and emerging technologies to identify and scale innovative online transportation services.</p>

						<p>Development Approach:</p>
                        <li>Agile Methodology: Agile Roadmap drives discovery and delivers incremental stakeholder value. Self-managed scrum teams decompose complexity and demonstrate stakeholder value at the end of sprints. Throughout the sprint, each team member changes their roles to ensure everyone has a chance to become the Scrum Master and take on other tasks.</li>


                        <li>
                            Quality & Improvement: Checkpoints, metrics, and feedback drive continuous improvement. The focus is on strategic, maintainable software over tactical programming, implementing Innovation Best Practices, System Design Best Practices, and Software Lifecycle Best Practices + Tools.

							<h4>A challange I have faced and how I overcame it...</h4>
							<ul>
                                <h5>Challenge</h5>
                                <li>
                                    During my time in software engineering, I faced the challenge of impostor syndrome, doubting my capabilities compared
                                     to others. For instance, when I transitioned to the role of DevOps, the team was well into the project.
                                      I was in charge of taking on the responsibility of setting up the final server for the vehicle simulator, and the thought of this
                                       was intimidating.</li>
                                    <h5>Solution</h5>
                                    <li>Despite having no prior knowledge in DevOps and with the previous DevOps engineer unavailable, 
                                        I heavily relied on existing documentation and research. Driven by determination, I navigated through multiple rounds 
                                        of error handling, addressed file path issues, and mastered various terminal commands. As a result, I was able to successfully 
                                        established our third and final server and seamlessly transitioned to my next task before the sprint's end.</li>
